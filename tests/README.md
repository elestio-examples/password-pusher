# Maintenance

## Logging

The Elestio Peertube Docker image sends the container logs to stdout. To view the logs, you can use the following command:

    docker-compose logs -f

To stop the stack you can use the following command:

    docker-compose down

## Backup and Restore with Docker Compose

To make backup and restore operations easier, we are using folder volume mounts. You can simply stop your stack with docker-compose down, then backup all the files and subfolders in the folder near the docker-compose.yml file.

Creating a ZIP Archive
For example, if you want to create a ZIP archive, navigate to the folder where you have your docker-compose.yml file and use this command:

    zip -r myarchive.zip .

Restoring from ZIP Archive
To restore from a ZIP archive, unzip the archive into the original folder using the following command:

    unzip myarchive.zip -d /path/to/original/folder

Starting Your Stack
Once your backup is complete, you can start your stack again with the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

That's it! With these simple steps, you can easily backup and restore your data volumes using Docker Compose.
